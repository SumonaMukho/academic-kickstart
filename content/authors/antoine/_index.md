I am a PhD student at the University of Washington in the [Natural  Language Processing Group](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp) advised by Professor [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin). My research centers on using deep learning to discover commonsense knowledge and simulate commonsense reasoning. I am also a researcher on the [Mosaic Project](https://mosaic.allenai.org) at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org).
<!--  and collaborate extensively with [Asli Celikyilmaz](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aslicel/) on the Deep Learning Team at MSR -->
Check out my <b><a target="_blank" href="files/cv.pdf">CV</a></b> for more details.

 <!-- I'm always happy to discuss projects with prospective researchers and have advised multiple students throughout my time at the University of Washington. -->
