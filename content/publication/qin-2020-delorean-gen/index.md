#abstract: "Abductive and counterfactual reasoning, core abilities of human cognition, involve hypothesizing with respect to given past and future observations. However, future observations pose a challenge for modern NLP methods based on language models (LMs), which are typically capable of conditioning only on past context. We propose an unsupervised LMbased approach that consists of alternating passes: a forward pass that concerns maintaining coherence with the past, and a backward pass that incorporates task-specific future constraints through backpropagation. We demonstrate our approach on the abductive and counterfactual generation tasks, where it significantly improves over a range of other unsupervised and some supervised methods, in terms of both automatic and human evaluation."
