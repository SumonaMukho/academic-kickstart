abstract: "Activities and events in our lives are structural, be it a vacation, a camping trip, or a wedding. While individual details vary, there are characteristic patterns that are specific to each of these scenarios. For example, a wedding typically consists of a sequence of events such as walking down the aisle, exchanging vows, and dancing. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to learning event knowledge from a large collection of photo albums. We formulate the task as constrained optimization to induce the prototypical temporal structure of an event, integrating both visual and textual cues. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that it is possible to learn multimodal knowledge of event structure from noisy web content."
